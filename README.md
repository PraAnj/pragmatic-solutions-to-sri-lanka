<h1> Why this repo? The problem definition </h1>

This repo is created to identify issues in the functioning of the country which hinders the progress of the country. These are at various instituations, consititutions, law and order, people behavior and thinking, political parties. Minor adjusments in behavior of people, policy reforms could bring drastic improvements in the system. We plan to identify them and push them to the relevent people to implement. 

<h1> What is(are) the proposed solution(s)? </h1>

We believe in the quote "Small things are the big things". Please find the solutions at separate md files. Summary of broader topis will be listed below in a chart.

1. Constitutional changes
2. Public instituational management
3. People thinking pattern and behavior
4. Industry specific recommendations

We need a solid plan on verifying the solutions before implementation state. This can be done via public opinion survey, member voting, expert level evaluation, statistical test or via any other consensus algorithm. If we have enough contributors, and support from university students these solutions can be evaluated as a project or via a proof of concept.

<h1> Why this approach? </h1>

We adopted this public, open forum to get ideas from various individuals to design a common framework for the country. This is called crowdsourcing. This open forum can be used to argue/challenge and come to a conclusion on which path we should take.

<h1> How can you contribute? </h1>

Please raise issues and pull requests to the repo directly. We can even add you as a contributor if you can constantly support this movement. We have few rules.

1. We do not blame/target/support any political party, hence please only mention names in a constructive opinion.
2. We target solutions, but you can add only the problems too.
3. Every solution should be presented with enough evidence for acceptance of wider audience.
4. If you are not comfortale with git pull requests, and issues, please send your proposal to my linkedIn profile.
